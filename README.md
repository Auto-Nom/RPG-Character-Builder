# RPG Character Builder

**This is in the very early stages and things may not work**


At the moment this only really works for D&D 5th Edition (or a homebrewed version thereof), but I plan to make it work for any tabeletop RPG if you edit the json data files accordingly.

The stuff in those files was taken from the D&D basic rules which are free [here](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules) and if you own the books it's fairly easy to add other classes and races by following the format in those files.

TODO:
* **make a GUI**
* add the ability to choose spells and buy equipment
* make it so that the program will work for any tabletop rpg, by simply editing the json data files, which someone with no programming knowledge could easily do (I think)
    * will make a more user friendly GUI version too
* add the ability to print out a character sheet, or save to a pdf which can then be printed


*I am not affiliated with Wizards of the Coast and all D&D stuff belongs to them.*
*I don't even know if I'm allowed to put up the data stuff taken from the free basic rules, but I doubt anybody will even see this, and if I'm not I'll take it the data down and just put an example of how to fill it in yourself*
